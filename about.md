## who am i

I am a software developer for a digital content creation company.
I used to develop software for the automotive market with a focus on computer graphics and vehicle positioning algorithms.
I program mostly in C++ but also in a few scripting languages.

## things i write about

I write about the projects that I work on. I do this for both sharing and documentation purposes. This lets me revisit solutions I have found or simply read some documentation of a previously created system of mine.
It also lets anyone who happens to stumple upon this site benefit from my work.

The main topics I write about are:
- home automation
- software development (specifically graphics and _C++_ related)
- software management with _Docker_
- _Linux_ usage and especially _Arch Linux_ and _Manjaro_ as these are the two distributions I mostly use
